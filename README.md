# Project Overview
This R project explores multiple machine learning and statistical inference techniques across diverse datasets and problem domains. It includes predictive modeling, model evaluation, regularization, bootstrapping, and classification using:

	•	German Credit Risk dataset
	•	Prostate Cancer dataset
	•	Red Wine Quality dataset
	•	Simulated financial returns

 ## Key Objectives
 Predict creditworthiness using logistic regression and cross-validation.
 
	•	Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC.
	•	Compare ridge and lasso regression for prostate cancer prediction using regularization paths and cross-validation.
	•	Analyze model selection bias in high-dimensional classification problems.
	•	Use bootstrap simulation to estimate portfolio allocation (optimal alpha) and its variability.
	•	Apply K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify wine quality and optimize model performance using k-fold CV.
